Frequently Asked Questions

## Where's my ticket to the hackathon?
We had an extensive *application* process that was detailed by Quincy on at https://hackathon.freecodecamp.org/. If you *successfully* completed this process, then you were sent a ticket to the email address provided in your application. 

## What is the JAMstack?
The JAMstack is a powerful new approach for deploying fast, highly scalable sites and applications that don't require backend infrastructure. Thanks to recent advancements in the web platform, developers can now run any web property, from simple sites to complex applications, on global CDNs and without a single web server. Learn more about how the JAMstack works [here](https://jamstackconf.com/what-is-jamstack).

## Can the online participants and in-person participants be on the same team?
Unfortunately no. This makes things needlessly complicated. Further, there are separate prizes and judging protocol for the online and in-person hackathon. If we discover that an in-person team has remote collaborators, the team will be disqualified.

## Can the online and in-person hackers still chat with one another?
Of course. We're all in the same Discord chat group. And since this hackathon is largely about education, the in-person and online groups should both help each other out by answering questions.

## Where is the Discord Channel?
Check your email for the Hackathon Discord Group invite.
